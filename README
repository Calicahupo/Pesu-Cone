This program is meant to facilitate hundreds of parallel simulations of several subjects which are controlled by an artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligence is based on an unprecedented metaphysical theory which incorporates Jungian psychology, Leary's Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness and the Analytic Metaphysics Of Quality. This theory is so complex that it can hardly be verified by any other means.

If the underlying theory can be verified by using this program it will also become possible to use the program to predict the outcomes of specific social situations. After this stage has been reached the program can be developed to simulate the spontaneous behavior of humans or animals in a virtual reality. Only then will a normal person become able to understand the relevance of the program. Before that, it is of interest only to those who have a knack for theoretical science.

The author began this project in 2003, at the age of sixteen, upon reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" by Robert Pirsig. Thereafter the author has proved Pirsig's original metaphysics to be inconsistent and presented an improvement. The author has also presented a provably consistent, complete and decidable arithmetic which includes negative numbers and subtraction, and a solution to the problem of induction, which is currently in peer-review.
