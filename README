This is alternative avantgarde research

This program is meant to facilitate hundreds of parallel simulations of several subjects which are controlled by an artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligence is based on an unprecedented metaphysical theory which incorporates Jungian psychology, Leary's Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness and the Analytic Metaphysics Of Quality.

If the underlying theory can be verified by using this program it will also become possible to use the program to predict the outcomes of specific social situations. After that stage has been reached the program can be developed to mimic spontaneous behavior of humans or animals. Only then will a normal person become able to understand the relevance of the entire program. However, the app includes a personality test which is already functional.
